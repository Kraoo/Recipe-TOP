# Odin Project Recipes

This project is a part of the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open-source coding curriculum designed to teach web development. The Recipes project focuses on building a simple webpage to showcase various recipes using HTML and CSS.

## Description

The Odin Recipes webpage displays a collection of recipes, including images and names of dishes. Each recipe is represented by an image and accompanied by its name. The page layout is designed to be visually appealing, with a header displaying the title "Odin Recipes" and a background image.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

To view the Odin Recipes webpage that I made, click the link on the side tab of the page.
